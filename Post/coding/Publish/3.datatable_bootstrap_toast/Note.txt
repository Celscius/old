Toast Example
A toast is like an alert box that is only shown for a couple of seconds when something happens (i.e. when a user clicks on a button, submits a form, etc.).

In this example, we use a button to show the toast message.

Creating the Toasts with Bootstrap
The toast component is newly introduced in Bootstrap 4. They are lightweight notifications 
similar to push notifications that are shown by web browsers on computer screens. They're built 
with flexbox, so you can easily align and position them on a web page.

Additionally, toasts are opt-in for performance reasons, like tooltips, so you must initialize 
them yourself with toast() method. Also, toasts will automatically hide after 500 milliseconds 
(0.5 second), if you do not specify autohide: false. Now let's see how to create a toast.

-toast will be shown in 5 second
-toast will appear in top center of the page
